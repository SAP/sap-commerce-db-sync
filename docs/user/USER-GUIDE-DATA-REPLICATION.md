# Commerce DB Sync - User Guide for Data Replication

It allows you to synchronize the data you select single-directionally (from CCV2) across an external database (either hosted on-Premise or on Public Cloud).

This external database can then be used for analytics and reporting purpose.

![architecture overview for data sync between SAP Commerce Cloud to an external database](data_replication_architecture.png)

It provides the following features:

* The Sync Schema describes which data(table/items) is being synchronized.
* The Sync Direction is only single-directional, which is from CCV2 to Onprem or another cloud MS Database.
* The Sync Interval describes how often synchronization occurs.

## Methodology for Data Sync

* Identify the tables you would like to sync (limit to the minimum that is required and avoid large tables when possible). Ex: do not sync task logs!
* Define a strategy to manage deletion if required, see **Support for deletion** section 
* Remove/Add indexes that are not necessary in the target db
* Create indexes on last modified timestamp for tables that supports incremental
* Full data migration with all tables
* Run incremental regularly (example every hour)
* Reconfigure full data migration cronjob to sync tables with no last modified timestamp
* Run full data migration cronjob regularly and during low activity (e.g. every day, 3PM) - this is to resolve any potential integrity issue during the regular incremental
* Ensure data migration cronjobs are running on the read-only database

## Limitations to consider with Data Sync

The following limitations should be considered when implementing Commerce DB sync for data sync use case:
* Not all Commerce tables contain last modified timestamp
   * It will usually the case in SAP Commerce for system tables (ex: PROPS, AUDIT_LOGS,â€¦)
   * There is an additional feature in SAP Commerce DB sync to support incremental migration for ***LP*** system table.
   * Other system tables will be usually relatively small and can be full sync each time
   * You should ensure you do not have any large table that does not contain timestamp
* Incremental update may create data integrity issue between two runs
   * During the cronjob execution, you may have some updates or creations that are not sync
   * There is no guaranty that some tables with relations may be partially sync, example Orders vs Orders items,
   * This should be acceptable for reporting or analytics use cases but it should be take into consideration for the application using the destination DB)
* Sync of master data (tables without last modified timestamp) may be delayed (e.g. 24 hours)
* Particular challenges comes with deletion managemement with incremental data sync and a strategy needs to be defined, see **Support for deletion** section
* Performance should be tested to tune batch size and number threads (memory and CPU on the application server)

## Support for deletion

SAP Commerce DB Sync does support deletions. It it can be enabled for the transactional table using two different approaches:
- Default Approach using After Save Event Listener
- Alternative approach using Remove Interceptor

See [Deletion Support](./SUPPORT-DELETE-GUIDE.md).

## Installation and Setup

### Install SAP Commerce DB Sync on your source system

- Add the following extensions to your **localextensions.xml**:
```
<extension name="commercedbsync"/>
<extension name="commercedbsynchac"/>
```

## CronJob Configuration reference Data Sync

Commerce DB Sync for data replication is managed by Cronjobs which allow you to trigger full and regular sync based on sync interval.

Following High-level details for the Cronjobs,
#### FullMigrationCronJob
It allows you to sync the full based on the list provided in CronJob settings.

#### IncrementalMigrationCronJob
It allows you to sync the delta based on modifiedTS hence tables must have the following columns: modifiedTS, PK. Furthermore, this is an incremental approach... only modified and inserted rows are taken into account. Deletions on the source side are not handled.

_**Note:**_ It's better to create separate Cronjobs for Language(LP) and non Language tables. The frequency of updates for the LP table is much lesser than Non-LP.
